 * What to do...
 Create a folder named lab4 in your development environment. In this folder, create a sub-folder called uploads.

 In the folder do the following:

 Create a web page using PHP to store your BC email address in one cookie and your BC student ID in a second cookie. The cookies are to expire in 14 days.
 Create a separate web page using PHP that will delete the two cookies.
 Create a separate web page using PHP that reads the two cookies created and displays the values stored in the two cookies. Ensure that the web page displays an appropriate message if the cookies have not been stored or have been deleted.
 In the folder do the following:

 Create a web page using PHP that will prompt a user for a file to upload. This web page must submit to itself and store the file selected by the user in the uploads folder.
 Create a separate web page using PHP that will list the files in the uploads folder. Next to each file, provide a Delete button that when clicked will delete the file from the uploads folder. When a file has been deleted, the web page that lists the files must be displayed. This page must show an appropriate message if there are no files in the uploads folder.
 What to submit...
 Zip the files in the lab4 folder into a zip file named HoangDoan-lab4.zip and attach to this assignment. Only .zip files will be accepted. DO NOT submit individual files.
